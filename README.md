This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## To clean up the question catalog if import faulty
- Remove all unnecessary texts before and after the questions
- After every 4-6 questions there is a footer and a header in the PDF
- Remove that Header and Footer by selecting the uniform beginning of the string in VScode using STRG + D
- Now your cursor is at every place in the string where said beginning is found
- Simply select the content you want to remove and now its removed for the whole document
